> Mob/Ensemble programming is a practice that yields significant value, facilitates effective knowledge sharing, reduces the lead time for changes, enhances work review processes, mitigates business risk, and fosters job satisfaction.
> When teams integrate it with other critical practices like trunk-based development and test-driven development, they can attain exceptional outcomes.
> I have yet to see one team that regretted adopting this way of working.
> I've heard some objections about exhaustion or being heavy for those favoring silo-working.
> Teams, however, should not work as groups of silos, and social programming practices can be executed sustainably and inclusively, involving and engaging both extroverts and introverts, transforming team gatherings into collaborative workshops rather than conventional meetings.
